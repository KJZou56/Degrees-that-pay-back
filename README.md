Money plays a big role in how happy we feel, especially when we are just getting started in life. One of the biggest decisions that we have to make early on is which college to attend and what major to study. So, the goal of this project is to look into how undergraduate majors, and school type and region may impact our ability to earn in the future?

# Degrees that pay you back

This graph could be very useful for high school graduates who are indecisive of what major to study for college.  Of course, salary should not be the only factor to consider when it comes to what major to study. But it definitely would be helpful to consider. In this graph, we are looking at 3 variables, starting median salary across 50 college majors, which is in color blue, mid-career median salary, which is in red, and last but not least, we have percentage change from starting to mid-career salary. It is clear to see that all 3 variables vary quite a bit across different undergraduate majors. Here, I am just gonna point out a few observations that I found interesting:
If we take a look at all the majors with starting median salary above 55,000 and mid-career median salary above 90,000. They are all STEM majors. STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and math. The only exceptions are information system and management information system, which are considered as STEM but these 2 majors don’t get paid as well as the other STEM majors. Another exception is the Physician Assistant major, which pays the highest starting median salary out of all majors but with the least income growth. 
Majors to avoid if salary is important to you are criminal justice, drama, education, interior design, music, nutrition, religion and Spanish. Not only do those majors pay much lower starting salary, even after working for a few years, it would be tough for those to make more than 55,000. Education is the worst among the worst in terms of income.
Parents usually are very much against philosophy major, but surprisingly it is one of the majors that have the highest growth rate in salaries, along with economics, international relations, marketing, math, physics and political science. 

# Is school type a good predictor of salaries?

So, this graph is to explore the relationships between starting median salary, mid-career median salary and school types. We have starting median salary as the x axis and mid-career median salary as the y axis. School types are Engineering, lvy league, Liberal arts, party and state, all represented by different colors and shapes. Engineering schools have the highest starting salary, which matches what we saw on our previous graph. But it is very speat out too. Ivy league schools don’t necessary guarantee the highest starting salaries, but graduates from Ivy league schools could mean highest earning potentials. They are very concentrated on very upper left corner. The other 3 types are very speat out: liberty arts schools have higher starting salary and mid-career salary than party and state schools. State schools are showing the lowest starting and mid-career salary. It looks like school type is a pretty good predictor for salaries.

# Is school region a good predictor of salaries?

Now, let’s take a look at regions. Same as previous graph, we have the starting salary as the x axis and mid-career salary as the y axis. We have 5 regions: California, Midwestern, Northeastern, southern and western. All regions look very spreat out. It does not look like region is good predictor for salaries.
